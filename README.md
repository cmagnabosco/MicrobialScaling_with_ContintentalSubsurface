# Microbial Scaling (Locey and Lennon, 2016) with data from the contintental subsurface

Code from https://github.com/LennonLab/ScalingMicroBiodiversity/ was adapted to incorporate diversity data from the continental subsurface was added to the master Figure 1 analysis of Locey and Lennon (2016). Biomass_Biodiversity_Fig3.py was used to generate Figure 3 of Magnabosco et al. (in review).
