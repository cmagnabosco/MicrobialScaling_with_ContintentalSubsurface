# Microbial Scaling (Locey and Lennon, 2016) with data from the contintental subsurface

Code from https://github.com/LennonLab/ScalingMicroBiodiversity/ was adapted to incorporate diversity data from the continental subsurface was added to the master Figure 1 analysis of Locey and Lennon (2016). Biomass_Biodiversity_Fig3.py was used to generate Figure 3 of Magnabosco et al. (in review).

## Files 

* Biomass_Biodiversity_Fig3.py: python script that accesses a directory named "data" that includes data from data.zip

* data.zip: contains data for continental subusrface. 

* For comparisons with Locey and Lennon (2016), the "micro" directory from https://github.com/LennonLab/ScalingMicroBiodiversity/tree/master/data/micro should also be added to the "data" directory
